# Stock market
By Isabelle Nguyen

##How to run
To run, download my files.  Open up my index.html on localhost.  You can do this by running ```python -m http.server``` or ```python3 -m http.server``` in the terminal.  Then, open localhost:PORT# on a web browser. Then, navigate to my index.html file to open.  

##Trade-offs
I would want to fix the stock pages which were off-centered.  When you refresh the page, the color of the button flashes for a bit, which shouldn't happen.
