# Stock market

##How to run
To run, download my files.  Open up my index.html on localhost.  You can do this by running ```python -m http.server``` or ```python3 -m http.server``` in the terminal.  Then, open localhost:PORT# on a web browser. Then, navigate to my index.html file to open.  

##If I had more time
I would want to add more functionality and make it look nicer.  When you refresh the page, the button flashes for a bit which shouldn't happen.
Also, my css file is a mess and I did id's when classes would have worked for some situations.
